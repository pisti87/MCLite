# MCLite for T-Deck Plus & T-Watch Ultra

Lightweight off-grid communicator firmware for the LilyGo T-Deck Plus and T-Watch Ultra. Built on [MeshCore](https://github.com/ripplebiz/MeshCore), MCLite is purpose-built for emergency and outdoor communication -- no internet, no cell towers, no training needed. Turn it on and communicate.

MCLite is ideal for groups, families, search and rescue teams, and anyone who needs reliable off-grid messaging. It is fully compatible with other MeshCore devices and companion apps (iOS, Android) -- MCLite users can communicate with anyone on the same MeshCore network. All configuration is done in a single file -- one person sets it up, copies it to everyone's SD card, and the whole group is ready to go. No accounts, no pairing, no per-device setup. Perfect for kids, older family members, or anyone who just needs it to work.

Most features below are optional. The primary goal is to keep things extremely simple -- anyone who can use a smartphone can use MCLite without explanation. Advanced features like telemetry, GPS sharing, or PIN lock are there when you need them, but they stay out of the way until then.

## Supported hardware

MCLite runs on two LilyGo ESP32-S3 boards. They share the same SX1262 LoRa radio, so they interoperate on the same mesh and run the same features -- pick whichever form factor suits you (or mix both in one group).

- **[T-Deck Plus](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-plus)** -- handheld with a physical QWERTY keyboard, trackball, GPS, and a 2.8" display. The original, fully-featured target.
- **[T-Watch Ultra](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-watch-ultra)** -- wrist-worn device with a 2.01" AMOLED touchscreen. Fully touch-driven with an on-screen keyboard.

## Quick Start

New here? Three steps, no toolchain or install needed:

1. **Flash** your T-Deck Plus or T-Watch Ultra from the browser with the [web flasher](https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/web-flasher/) (Chrome or Edge).
2. **Configure** your identity, contacts, and channels in the offline [config tool](https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/config-tool/mclite_config_tool.html), then download `config.json`.
3. **Copy** `config.json` to the SD card, insert it, and power on.

That's it. Full walkthrough — including updates and companion mode — in [Getting Started](#getting-started) below.

## Features

*Release history and per-version changes: see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).*

- **Direct messages** -- private encrypted conversations between contacts
- **Channels** -- group communication via shared or public channels, with optional read-only (listen-only) mode
- **Room servers** -- join community message boards run by MeshCore room servers (up to 8). Posts arrive on the conversation list with an `R` icon, ordered alongside DMs and channels by last activity. Auto-login on boot with retry; re-login on chat-open and after 10 minutes of silence to recover from brief radio dropouts.
- **Heard adverts** -- browse a rolling 64-entry list of every device your radio has decoded, reachable from the admin screen. Per-row type icon (chat / repeater / room / sensor), hops, last-heard age, GPS when present. Tap a chat advert for the full per-hop path + fingerprint and a one-tap **Save** that adds it to your contact list (queued, applies on next reboot). Manual-advert button announces yourself on demand without waiting for the next periodic cycle
- **SOS alerts** -- long-press the trackball (hold 6 seconds) to broadcast an emergency alert
- **Battery alerts** -- automatic low-battery warnings sent to your contacts
- **GPS location sharing** -- manually send your position in lat/lon or UTMREF/MGRS (military grid) format, used by search and rescue worldwide. Last-known position support when GPS signal is temporarily lost. Optionally **broadcast your location in adverts** (`location_advert`, off by default) so contacts see you on their map -- note adverts are unencrypted and reach everyone in range, unlike targeted per-contact telemetry
- **Telemetry** -- responds to MeshCore-standard telemetry requests (battery, GPS) with per-contact permissions. Compatible with MeshCore companion apps. Optionally request telemetry from contacts to see their battery, location, and distance
- **Map view** -- visualise positions on a slippy map (optional, requires tile pack on SD card). Tap a contact's name in chat for their position, or tap the **status-bar GPS icon** for the general map: your own location plus markers for every heard node / contact that carries GPS (same chat / repeater / room / sensor symbols as the heard-adverts list). Tap a marker for its name, drag to pan, zoomable, with Center and Reload buttons
- **Message history** -- conversations saved to SD card and restored on reboot
- **Quick replies** -- optional canned message picker for fast responses (OK, Copy, Need help, etc.), translatable and customizable
- **Multi-language** -- English, German, French, and Italian included. Add your own translations via SD card
- **Notification sounds** -- chime on incoming messages, alarm on SOS. Supports custom WAV files from SD card
- **Haptic feedback** (T-Watch Ultra) -- vibration on incoming messages and SOS alerts, independent of the sound mute
- **Real-time clock** (T-Watch Ultra) -- battery-backed RTC keeps accurate time across reboots and before the first GPS fix
- **Auto-dim** -- screen and keyboard backlight dim after inactivity to save battery
- **Multiple input methods** -- QWERTY keyboard, trackball, and touchscreen
- **Screen lock** -- hold the trackball for 1 second to lock. Key lock blocks all input and unlocks with another 1s hold. PIN lock requires a code to unlock. Optional auto-lock on display dim
- **Region scope** -- tag outgoing packets with MeshCore transport codes so repeaters can filter by region. Set a global scope or override per channel/room
- **Path hash mode** -- configurable repeater path fingerprint size (1/2/3 bytes per hop). Larger sizes reduce path collisions in dense meshes at the cost of a few extra bytes per hop. Defaults to 1 byte for compatibility with pre-v1.15 peers
- **Offgrid mode** -- one-flag toggle that switches to the community offgrid frequency (433/869/918 MHz, auto-picked from your normal frequency) and relays packets for other offgrid nodes. Camping / hiking / SAR scenarios where no repeaters exist. Toggle on-device from the admin screen or via config tool, reboot to apply. While offgrid, only other offgrid peers receive your messages, SOS, and battery alerts.
- **Update from SD card** -- drop a firmware `.bin` on the SD card and the device offers to install it on boot (or from the admin screen) -- no USB needed
- **Update over WiFi** -- optionally connect to WiFi on-device (scan + enter password) and check GitHub for newer firmware; download and install with one tap. Off by default
- **Companion mode (WiFi / USB / BLE)** -- bridge the radio to a phone/desktop/CLI using the standard MeshCore companion protocol, *in parallel* with normal on-device use (messages appear in both). BLE pairs with the **official MeshCore mobile apps** (6-digit PIN); WiFi/USB work with `meshcore-cli`/`meshcore.js`/`meshcore_py`. One transport at a time; messaging is read-only for config (no remote edits). See note below
- **Zero-config for end users** -- all settings live in one JSON file on the SD card. Set it up once, copy to every device in your group

## Getting Started

### Install the firmware

**Option 1: Web Flasher (recommended)**

Visit the [MCLite Web Flasher](https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/web-flasher/), **choose your device** (T-Deck Plus or T-Watch Ultra), select a version, and flash directly from your browser. The flasher walks you through putting your board into download mode. No software to install -- just Chrome/Edge and a USB cable.

**Option 2: Manual**

Download the latest binary for your board from the [Releases](../../releases) page -- `mclite-v*.bin` for the **T-Deck Plus**, `mclite-watch-v*.bin` for the **T-Watch Ultra** -- and flash with esptool at offset `0x0`:

```
esptool.py write_flash 0x0 mclite-v0.3.2.bin          # T-Deck Plus
esptool.py write_flash 0x0 mclite-watch-v0.3.2.bin    # T-Watch Ultra
```

The T-Watch Ultra has no power switch -- if esptool can't connect, put it in download mode manually: hold **BOOT**, tap **RST**, release **BOOT**.

### Updating the firmware (on-device, no USB)

Once MCLite is installed you can update it without a computer:

- **From SD card** -- copy a newer merged binary (`mclite-v*.bin` for the T-Deck Plus, `mclite-watch-v*.bin` for the T-Watch Ultra) to the SD card. On the next boot the device detects it and offers **Install / Cancel**, then flashes and reboots. The file is renamed afterwards so it won't re-prompt.
- **Over WiFi** -- on the device go to **Admin → WiFi**, switch WiFi on, pick your network and enter the password (saved for next time), then tap **Check for updates**. If a newer release exists on GitHub it downloads and installs. Enable **auto-update** (config tool → WiFi, or it checks on boot when on) to be prompted automatically.

### Companion mode

Use a phone, desktop, or CLI as a companion to the radio while the device keeps working normally — messages appear in **both** places at once. MCLite speaks the standard MeshCore companion protocol over three transports (**one active at a time**): **Bluetooth**, **WiFi**, and **USB**. Messaging is **read-only for config** — a companion can read contacts/channels and send/receive messages, but can't change radio settings, contacts, channels, or keys.

#### Bluetooth (official mobile apps)

The way to use the official MeshCore **iOS / Android** apps.

1. On the device: **Admin → Bluetooth**. The screen shows a 6-digit **pairing PIN** (generated once and saved).
2. Turn the **Bluetooth Companion** switch on — the device advertises as `MeshCore-<name>`.
3. In the app: scan, pick this device, and enter the PIN when prompted. It bonds once and reconnects automatically.

The Bluetooth status-bar icon turns **green** while a client is connected.

#### WiFi (desktop / CLI on your LAN)

1. On the device: **Admin → WiFi**, switch WiFi **on** and connect to your network.
2. Turn on the **WiFi Companion** switch (enabled once WiFi is connected). The row shows `Companion <ip>:5000`.
3. From a computer on the same network:
   ```
   pip install meshcore-cli
   meshcore-cli -t <device-ip> -p 5000 infos      # or: contacts, recv, chan_msg, etc.
   ```
   (`meshcore.js` and `meshcore_py` work too.) The status-bar WiFi icon turns **green** while a client is attached. Note: the WiFi transport has **no pairing/auth** (the protocol's only auth is the Bluetooth passkey) — only enable it on networks you trust.

#### USB (wired, computer)

Turn on the **USB Companion** switch (**Admin → USB**; works with WiFi off), then connect over the USB-CDC port:
```
meshcore-cli -s /dev/ttyACM0 infos
```
While USB companion is active the device's **serial debug logging is muted** — the binary protocol and log text can't share the one USB port (there's no spare log UART on these boards). Logs resume the moment you turn it off. The charge bolt turns **green** while a USB client is bridging.

#### Notes

- **One transport, one client at a time** — the modes are mutually exclusive by design (the protocol is single-session). Turning one on turns the others off.
- **WiFi vs Bluetooth can't run together** — they share the 2.4 GHz radio and there isn't enough RAM for both. Enabling Bluetooth turns WiFi off; once Bluetooth has been used, **switching back to WiFi needs a reboot** (the BLE stack can't be freed at runtime). The WiFi screen shows a notice and a **Reboot** button when this applies.
- **Known limitation** — messages **typed on the device itself** do not appear in the companion app. The MeshCore companion protocol has no event for a firmware-composed message (it assumes the app is the sole composer). Everything else mirrors both ways: received messages and app-sent messages show on the device *and* in the app.

### Set up your config

**Option 1: Config Tool (recommended)**

1. Open the [MCLite Config Tool](https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/config-tool/mclite_config_tool.html) in any web browser (or use the local file at `tools/config-tool/mclite_config_tool.html`). It works offline -- no internet needed, nothing to install.
2. The **Setup Wizard** opens automatically and walks you through the essentials: device name, region, key pair, and default channels. For more detailed settings (telemetry, GPS format, PIN lock, etc.), use the full editor after completing the wizard.
3. Click **Export** to download `mclite-config.zip` (includes config and language files)
4. Unzip and copy all contents to the root of your SD card
5. Insert the SD card and power on -- done

To set up a group: use **Fleet Mode** in the Setup Wizard. Add a device for each person in your group, generate keys for all, then export -- the tool creates a ZIP with a folder per device, each containing `config.json` and language files. Copy each folder's contents to the corresponding SD card and you're done.

**Option 2: Blank SD card (quick start)**

1. Insert a blank FAT32-formatted SD card (max 32 GB) and power on
2. MCLite auto-generates a unique identity and creates a default config with the Public and #mclite channels
3. The device is immediately functional -- you can send and receive on both channels
4. To add contacts, channels, or change settings (language, radio preset, etc.): open the Config Tool, click **Import** to load the auto-created `config.json` from your SD card, make your changes, click **Export**, and copy the updated file back to the SD card

### Map tiles (optional)

If you want a visual map view when tapping a contact's name in chat (Telemetry → **Map**), copy slippy map tiles to `/tiles/` on the SD card root:

```
/tiles/<zoom>/<x>/<y>.png    (256×256 PNG, Web Mercator / EPSG:3857)
```

This is the same layout used by MeshCore's official T-Deck firmware, so any existing tile pack works unchanged. Zoom levels are auto-detected from the folder names present.

**Getting tiles**: [map-tiles-downloader](https://github.com/tekk/map-tiles-downloader) is a terminal tool (TUI) that produces exactly this layout -- pick a country/region, zoom range, tile source, and export.

Region codes in that tool are GeoNames admin1 codes, not the local administrative numbers you may be familiar with. For Germany, a few common ones: `02` = Bayern, `04` = Hamburg, `07` = Nordrhein-Westfalen, `16` = Berlin. Check the [GeoNames admin1 codes list](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/admin1CodesASCII.txt) for other countries.

## Hints

**Controls & shortcuts**

The T-Deck Plus is keyboard + trackball driven; the T-Watch Ultra is touch driven with two physical buttons (lower = BOOT, upper = PWR). Touch shortcuts work the same on both.

| Action | T-Deck Plus | T-Watch Ultra |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Admin / device info | Sym + 0 | Short-press upper (PWR) button |
| Lock / unlock | Hold trackball 1s | Hold lower (BOOT) button 1s |
| SOS broadcast | Hold trackball 6s | Hold lower (BOOT) button 6s |
| Power off | Slide the power switch | Long-press upper (PWR) button |
| Mute / unmute | Tap speaker icon in status bar | Same |
| Contact telemetry | Tap contact name in chat header | Same |
| Retry failed message | Tap the X on a failed message | Same |
| Quick reply | Tap the list icon (≡) by the text input | Same |

**Conversation list icons**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| @ | Direct message (contact) |
| # | Public or hashtag channel |
| * | Private channel |
| R | Room server (purple) |
| Green eye | Contact recently seen on the mesh |
| Green dot | Unread messages |
| Battery / GPS | Contact's last reported telemetry |

**Status bar**

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| GPS | Green = live fix, amber = last known, gray = no fix, dimmed = GPS disabled. **Tap to open the map** |
| Battery | Charge level; charging symbol when plugged in |

**Map view** (needs offline tiles on the SD card -- see [Map tiles](#map-tiles-optional))

Open it by tapping the **GPS icon** in the status bar (works even when GPS is off -- the icon stays dimmed but tappable), or from a contact's telemetry pop-up via **Map** (which opens the same map centered on that contact, with it highlighted). It's one map either way -- it always shows every node whose location we know: contacts (from a telemetry request or their advert), heard nodes, and your own position.

Markers use the same letters and colors as the Heard Adverts list, drawn as a filled dot with the symbol on top:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| @ (blue) | Chat client that's a saved contact |
| @ (grey) | Chat client heard on the mesh (not a contact) |
| P | Repeater |
| R | Room server |
| S | Sensor |
| Green / amber dot | **Your own** position (green = live fix, amber = last known) -- distinct from node markers |

- **Tap a marker** to show its name in the bottom bar; the selected one gets a ring and a slightly larger dot.
- **Center** (GPS button) centers on your own location as soon as a fix is available; with no fix it returns to where the map opened (the contact, or a nearby node).
- **Reload** (↻) re-scans all node locations and re-checks your own, without moving the view.
- **Drag** to pan, **+ / −** to zoom.

**Message delivery indicators**

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Single check | Message sent, waiting for acknowledgement |

**SOS keyword** -- incoming messages containing "SOS" (default) trigger an alert sound. The same keyword is sent via the trackball long-press SOS. Best left unchanged so all devices recognize each other's alerts.

## Radio Compatibility

MCLite uses MeshCore for radio communication and is compatible with other MeshCore devices. Built-in radio presets:

- **EU/UK/CH**: 869.618 MHz, SF8, BW62.5, CR8, 22 dBm
- **US/Canada**: 910.525 MHz, SF7, BW62.5, CR5, 22 dBm
- **Australia Wide**: 915.800 MHz, SF10, BW250, CR5, 22 dBm
- **Australia Victoria**: 916.575 MHz, SF10, BW250, CR5, 22 dBm

All devices in your group must use the same radio settings. Compatible with both 1-byte and 2-byte repeaters.

### Regulatory Compliance

**EU/UK/CH (868 MHz)**: MCLite enforces the ETSI EN 300 220 duty cycle limit for the G3 sub-band (869.40–869.65 MHz). TX duty cycle is capped at 10% through MeshCore's airtime budget mechanism. The Admin screen shows real-time channel utilization so you can verify compliance.

**US/Canada (915 MHz)**: The US ISM band (902–928 MHz) has no duty cycle restriction under FCC Part 15.247. MCLite uses the MeshCore default airtime budget (33%).

**Australia (915 MHz)**: The 915–928 MHz ISM band is available under ACMA class licence (LIPD-2015). MCLite uses the MeshCore default airtime budget (33%).

> **Disclaimer**: MCLite is experimental open-source software, not a certified radio product. The firmware-level duty cycle cap is provided as a best-effort aid, not a guarantee of regulatory compliance. The operator is solely responsible for ensuring that their complete setup (firmware, hardware, antenna, configuration) complies with all applicable local laws and regulations. The authors accept no liability for non-compliance or any consequences arising from the use of this software.

### Pre-filled preset links for local groups

Running a regional MCLite group? You can publish a **preset link** that opens the config tool with your channels, radio settings, contacts, boot text, and more already filled in — visitors only need to add their own identity before exporting.

1. Open the [Config Tool](https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/config-tool/mclite_config_tool.html) and configure the settings you want to share.
2. Choose **Share preset link…** from the ⋯ menu (top-right).
3. Tick the sidebar sections to include — `Device` (name, identity keys) and `Security` (PIN, lock mode) are always excluded.
4. Copy the generated URL and embed it on your site, just like the Config Tool button:

```html
<!-- Pre-filled config link (replace the # fragment with your generated preset) -->
<a href="https://laserir.github.io/MCLite/tools/config-tool/mclite_config_tool.html#preset=YOUR_BASE64_PAYLOAD">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laserir/MCLite/main/docs/images/btn-group-preset.svg" alt="Open MCLite Group Preset" height="48">
</a>
```

The preset is encoded entirely in the URL fragment (`#preset=…`), so it's never sent to a server. Opening the link generates a fresh keypair and overlays your shared settings on top — the visitor reviews them in the **Preset applied** banner before exporting.
